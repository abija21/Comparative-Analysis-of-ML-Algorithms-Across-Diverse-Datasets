# Comparative-Analysis-of-ML-Algorithms-Across-Diverse-Datasets
This project conducts a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms across multiple real-world datasets. The goal is to compare the performance of Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Neural Networks in handling various classification tasks. 

Datasets used include: 
  - Handwritten Digits Recognition (Multiclass classification)
  - Titanic Survival Prediction (Binary classification)
  - Loan Eligibility Prediction (Binary classification)
  - Oxford Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection (Binary classification)

By analyzing model performance across these datasets, this project demonstrates effective algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing techniques to optimize accuracy and generalizability.
